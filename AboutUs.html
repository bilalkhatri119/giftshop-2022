          known before.I can't imagine what my life would be without you. I want to spend the rest of my life with
          you.You have given me so much love and encouragement that I don’t think I will be able to return all that to
          you.
          You have been lighting up the dark and bringing joy to my heart.When I am with you I feel alive and strong.I
          am truly blessed to have you as a part of my life and I cannot wait for the day when we start a new life.When

          reason behind every joy that has ever been a part of my life. You are the one who made me see the beauty of
          things.Before you came into my life, I was sad, alone and broken.Then you came in and turned my world around
          and changed everything for the better. I cannot thank you enough, all I can do to repay you is to love you
          unconditionally and whole heartedly.You are every dream of mine come true and I love you with all my heart and
          soul.</p>

        <p>I don't think I express my appreciation to you often enough for having given me so many happy years, so I've
          decided to write this letter--an anniversary card just doesn't say enough.This way I can sit down and gather
          my thoughts together and present them to you with a small token of my love.I know you've always enjoyed
          Gilbert & Sullivan musical comedies, so I've purchased tickets for us to see "The Pirates of Penzance" on
          Saturday evening.I believe that's one we saw when we started dating so many years ago.We were always going to
          musicals and plays back then.I remember that "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was your favorite Shakespearean
          comedy.After we were married, though,our children started arriving quickly and our theater-going days
          diminished rapidly.I don't think that either one of us minded too much, though,because our kids always seemed
          to provide enough entertainment of their own.How I admired your parenting skills through the years!I will
          always be grateful for the help you gave me, too.</p>

        <h3 class="hdng"><b>Birthday Gifts:</b></h3>
        <p> Birthday is an occasion when a person or institution celebrates the anniversary of their birth. Birthdays
          are celebrated i numerous cultures, often with a gift, party, or rite of passage.Many religions celebrate the
          birth of their founders with special holidays.Note the distinction between birthday and birthdate:In most
          legal systems, one becomes designated as an adult on a particular birthday (usually between 12 and 21), and
          reaching age-specific milestones confers particular rights and responsibilities. At certain ages, one may
          become eligible to leave full-time education, or become subject to military conscription or to enlist in the
          military, to consent to sexual intercourse, to marry, to marry without parental consent, to vote, to run for
          elected office, to legally purchase (or consume) alcohol and tobacco products, to purchase lottery tickets, or
          to obtain a driver's licence.</p>

        <p>Christmas occassions and Christmas Day is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,observed
          most commonly on December as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A
          feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity
          Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and
          culminates on Twelfth Night in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave.Christmas Day is a public
          holiday in many of the world's nations,is celebrated culturally by a large number of non-Christian people,and
          is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several
          countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with
          gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family.</p>

        <p>Kids Gifts, according to a pseudoscientific New Age concept,are children who are believed to possess special,
          unusual, and sometimes supernatural traits or abilities.They are sometimes also referred to as crystal
          children or star children.The idea is based on concepts developed in the 1970s by Nancy Ann Tappe and further
          developed by Jan Tober and Lee Carroll. The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the
          publication of a series of books in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. A
          variety of books, conferences and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo
          children and their nature and abilities. The interpretations of these beliefs range from their being the next
          stage in human evolution, in some cases possessing paranormal abilities such as telepathy, to the belief that
          they are more empathetic and creative than their peers.</p>
